*Canek is an R package to correct batch effects from single-cell RNA-seq biological replicates*.

### Motivation to develop Canek

As single-cell genomics technologies become mainstream, more laboratories will perform experiments under different conditions with biological replicates obtained using a common technology. In this scenario, integration of datasets with minimal impact on cell phenotype is essential.

### The workflow

Canek leverages information from mutual nearest neighbors to combine local linear corrections with cell-specific non-linear corrections within a fuzzy logic framework.

> A. Canek starts with a reference batch and query batch, assuming a predominantly linear batch effect.
>
> B. Cell clusters are defined on the query batch and MNN pairs (arrows) are used to define batch effect observations.
>
> C. The MNN pairs from each cluster are used to estimate cluster specific correction vectors. These vectors can be used to correct the batch effect or, (D) a non-linear correction can be applied by calculating cell-specific correction vectors using fuzzy logic.

### Results

Canek was the highest scored method in tests specifically designed to assess **over-correction**, where Canek corrected batch effects without distortion to the structures of cells as compared with a gold standard.
